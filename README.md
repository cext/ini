ini v1.0.1
==========

This is a minimalistic ini file reader for C. It is simple, straightforward,
and does not get in your way. It will read an ini file and return its contents
in the form of a C structure. There is no logic, no interpretation, no setup,
and thus no overhead. Use this to access your ini files as if they were written
in memory, then work with them however you see fit.
